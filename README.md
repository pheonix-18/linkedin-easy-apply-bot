Need? Job Search is boring!!! 

Clicking and scrolling through hundreds of job descriptions, and then applying to each one individually is a tedious process.

# How it works?

Bot will, 
1. Open LinkedIn and login with your credentials.
2. Searches for your job title and location.
3. Applies filters to show only Easy Apply jobs.
4. Opens each job description, takes consent to and applies to the job.
5. Moves to next job and repeats the process.


# Current Usage

Please note that this bot is still in development. 

Currently, the bot applies for contractor positions, however, with slight modification to filter settings, one can adjust 
for interships, full-times. This is a work in progress..
